I check the Rotation.jl package, and here is the difference I noticed:

* More complete
They have a lot more stuff defined for each type of rotation, and they also have more rotation types, for example, they have two types for axis angle: RotationVec and AngleAxis.

* StaticArray instead of AbstractArray as a super type

* No EuclideanCoord type.
They use SVector directly

* Introducing Rotation{N, T} as an abstract type
All other rotation is a subtype of it, e.g. axis angle, RotMatrix...
